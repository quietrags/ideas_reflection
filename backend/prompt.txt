Below is a template and an example of how you should process an input text. Given an article excerpt, your task is to identify its main claims, evidence supporting those claims, analogies, inferences, and relationships among ideas. Then you will produce a structured JSON output following the specified format. Focus on precision, variety, and clarity in categorizing evidence and identifying analogies. If multiple inferences or analogies are possible, include them.

Instructions:
	1.	Claims: Identify the text’s main arguments or assertions. Claims often present a central idea or position the author wants the reader to consider.
	2.	Evidence and Support: For each claim, locate specific evidence the author provides. Evidence can take various forms:
	•	Historical Context: Past events or historical references.
	•	Academic Precedents or Authoritative References: Ideas or research from established scholars or earlier works.
	•	Contrast or Comparison with Conventional Views: Showing how the claim differs from common assumptions.
	•	Concrete Examples or Empirical Data: If provided.
Assign a type to each piece of evidence (e.g., “Historical Context,” “Authorial Perspective,” “Conceptual Clarification,” “Contrasts with Conventional Notions”). Aim for variety and accuracy in categorizing evidence types.
	3.	Analogies: Identify explicit or implicit analogies (comparisons) the author uses to clarify or emphasize concepts. Make sure these analogies highlight a parallel between two domains (e.g., human prestige vs. webpage importance). If the text presents more conceptual contrasts than strict analogies, still try to frame them as comparisons that reveal underlying principles. Include:
	•	comparison: What two things or concepts are being compared?
	•	implication: What insight does this analogy provide?
	4.	Inferences: Draw out one or more inferences or implications that logically follow from the claims and evidence. These are conclusions that the reader can infer, even if not explicitly stated by the author.
	5.	Relationships: Show how the claims, evidence, and analogies interconnect. Use type to label each relationship (e.g., “Justification,” “Extension,” “Contrast,” “Authorial_Intention,” “Conceptual_Link”). Reference the IDs of claims, evidence, and analogies you’ve listed. For example:
	•	"from": "C1" and "to": "E1" might describe evidence justifying a claim.
	•	"from": "C2" and "to": "A1" might link a claim to an analogy for conceptual reinforcement.
	6.	User Guidance: Provide a brief section guiding users on how to read and interpret the JSON structure. Offer a logical path for understanding the text’s argumentation and highlight any broader implications.

Formatting Guidelines:
	•	Output must be in JSON format.
	•	Use unique IDs such as C1, C2 for claims, E1, E2 for evidence, A1, A2 for analogies, and I1, I2 for inferences.
	•	Ensure every claim that has evidence is referenced by that evidence.
	•	If multiple analogies or inferences are present, list them all.
	•	Keep text concise and closely tied to the excerpt.
	•	Include a variety of evidence types where possible.

Example Input:
“In the late 1990s, Google’s PageRank algorithm revolutionized search engines by measuring webpage importance based on the quality and quantity of incoming links, rather than just matching user queries to keyword frequency. This approach mirrored older sociological and bibliometric principles: that prestige or influence can be measured by who endorses whom. By applying this principle to the web, PageRank acknowledged that language and importance emerge in a social network of links, not in isolated texts.”
